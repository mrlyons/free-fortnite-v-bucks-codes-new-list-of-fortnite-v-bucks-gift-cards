**Beware of V-Bucks Scams**

One word of caution: Be careful where you get your free V-Bucks codes from. Scammers often prey on players by offering free V-Bucks in exchange for personal information or access to your Epic Games account. To stay safe, always use legitimate sources‚Äîlike the official Fortnite website, Epic Games Store, or trusted community resources.

All the codes we provide are from reliable, verified sources and do not require you to enter any personal data other than your Epic Games login information. Stay clear of sites that ask for sensitive details like your credit card number or home address, as these are likely scams.
